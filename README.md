Hebrew Language Detoxification

To identify content relevant for detoxification, we applied a few-shot classification approach based on chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, using definitions derived from the Simplified Offensive Language (SOL) Taxonomy proposed by B. LewandowskaSimplified. This taxonomy offers a linguistically grounded yet computationally feasible framework for detecting offensive language. It introduces a stepwise structure that begins by assessing whether a comment is offensive, and proceeds to categorize its target (individual, group, or a group represented through an individual), as well as its level of vulgarity.
The full prompt is provided in this repository as a pdf image.
